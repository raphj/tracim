## Code formatting and others checks

### Pre-commit

:warning: you need at least pythonÂ 3.6 to run pre-commit (because of black requirement)

If you want to contribute to Tracim, in order to follow most Tracim guidelines, please use the precommit mechanism
to automatically check some of them before committing. 

To use it, you need the `pre-commit` Python package (installed automatically with `pip install -e ".[dev]"` on the backend)
you can then install hooks with:

    pre-commit install

Then the pre-commit will run when you run `git commit` normally. You should see automatic checks running.

### More informations
- check [backend/README.txt]('./backend/README.txt) for more information about used code
formatting check in backend.
